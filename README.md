# text-editor
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
It is a Java application built on top of Swing and AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). This 
text editor is a powerful, pure Java text editor primarily targeted for use by programmers. 
This application is a replica of Microsoft’s Notepad we all are familiar with and which 
we use daily. The only difference being that, this editor has been created using Java.
It is a platform-independent desktop application. Java delivers consistent graphical user 
interfaces across a wide range of operating systems and devices and it was designed to be 
easy to use and is therefore much easy to write, compile, debug and run. This allows a 
programmer to create a modular maintainable application and reusable code.
Why we created a simple text editor? What is the motivation behind creating a simple 
text editor and not a complex text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?
We created a Simple Text Editor because being programmer we think practice makes you 
perfect in any programming language and if you practice without any help like writing 
code in a simple text editor and do everything on your own helps you to understand the 
programming language.
On the other hand, IDE has so many tools which help programmers do things fast but the 
main drawback of this technique is that the programmer doesn’t know what is happening 
behind the scene everything is done for you by the IDE which is just like magic and this 
magic is dangerous for those who want to learn a programming language and be a good 
programmer.
After all, we all know there is no magic in computer/ computer programming.
The basic functionality of this text editor:
• The user can either open the files already existing in the system or open a new 
blank file.
• Text Editor can display the contents of a file in a window along with horizontal 
and vertical scrollbars.
• The user will be able to type and delete character in the text. 
• The user will be able to set the font and font size. 
• This text editor can handle cut, copy and paste operations.
• This text editor is also able to delete selected text.
• The text edited in the editor is stored in the desired location.
• The user can save the file in any desired format like txt, java, c, cpp, js, py, html, 
css, jsp, xml etc.
• There are menu commands for opening and saving text files.
• The files can be saved in the location specified by the user.
• The application is provides some shortcut keys to perform the operations such as 
for new file press Ctrl + N, for saving the document press Ctrl + S, to undo press 
Ctrl + Z etc.
                                  **Abstract**
This application is a Java-based Text Editor. The main advantage of using Java in this 
project is that the project is platform-independent. It is a desktop application.
Another motivation to use Java is, it delivers consistent graphical user interfaces across a 
wide range of operating systems and devices and it was designed to be easy to use and is 
therefore much easy to write, compile, debug and run. This allows a programmer to 
create a modular maintainable application and reusable code.
Text Editors are the most commonly used software for writing documentation, plain texts 
and project source codes. Notepad, WordPad, etc. are some of the popular text editor 
tools with various features and options during project design, development and 
implementation, text editors play an important role.
Each text editor has unique features. Old text editors support just plain text while new 
Text editors support advances features such as adding images, links and many more. This 
proposed Text Editor is simple application with minimum features.
This application is highly inspired by Microsoft’s Notepad. It is a replication of the 
notepad editor we all are familiar with and which we use quite often daily. The only 
difference being that, this editor has been created using Java.
Some features of this application are:
• Users can either open the files already existing in the system or open a new blank 
file.
• Text Editor can display the contents of a file in a window along with horizontal 
and vertical scrollbars.
• Text editor is able to handle window resize operation and work correctly when 
window is resized.
• Users can save the file in any desired format like txt, java, c, cpp, js, py, html, etc.
• The file is stored in the location specified by the user.
• The text edited in the editor is stored in the desired location.
• Users can change the background color and foreground color this application 
provides three different background colors.
• This text editor also lets the user cut, copy, and paste the edited text.
• The user is allowed to undo and redo the text edited.
• Word wrap feature is used to wrap the text within the area which is visible to the 
user.
• Users can change the font. Text Editor provides three fonts Arial, Comic Sans 
MS, and Times New Roman.
• Users can also change the font size as per need.
• The application is provides some shortcut keys to perform the operations. This 
will increase the productivity.
